# ccm-core

Ember addon used to share components, services, etc. for AT/ccMixter sites.

This addon will install itself when you install one of those sites.

## Development


* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `npm link`
* in the project directory of the site site: `npm link ccm-core`

With this last step, any changes you make in the ccm-core tree will be reflected in the site's project dir.
